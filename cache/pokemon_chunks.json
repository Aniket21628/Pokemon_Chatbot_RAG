Gold and Silver were first released on November 21, 1999, in Japan.\nThe games are set in the Johto region, which is based on the real-world Kansai region of Japan. Due to the games acting as a sequel to the first generation of the franchise, the Pokémon designs of the second generation share a strong association with those from the first. Some Pokémon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before Gold and Silver were released. The games also introduced several new types of Pokémon, introducing the elemental types Dark and Steel, a subset of Pokémon called \"Baby Pokémon\", and differently colored versions of Pokémon called Shiny Pokémon.\nThe following list details the 100 Pokémon of the second generation in order of their in-game \"Pokédex\" index order. Alternate forms introduced in subsequent games in the series, such as Mega Evolutions and regional variants, are included on the pages for the generation in which the specific form was introduced.",

The release of Pokémon Gold and Silver on the Game Boy Color additionally allowed for more freedom in creating the colors of species in comparison to the prior generation, which tended to have simpler color schemes than those from the second generation.\nTwo new types were introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver – the \"Dark\" and \"Steel\" types – intended to better balance the gameplay of Pokémon battles.

Two further species were introduced in a 2018 update to the spin-off mobile game Pokémon Go, as well as the 2018 core series Nintendo Switch games Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, culminating in a total of 88 different species. Some Pokémon species in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before Sun and Moon.\nFollowing Pokémon X and Y, all Pokémon have been designed by a team of roughly 20 artists, led by Ken Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida. The events of Sun and Moon take place in the fictional region of Alola, composed entirely of tropical islands. Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! are set in the Kanto region, the same setting as generation one. Pokémon Go is an augmented reality mobile game which uses the GPS and camera functions on the players' smartphones to display wild Pokémon in the player's surrounding environment.\nThe following list details the 88 Pokémon of Generation seven in order of their National Pokédex number. Pokémon number 722 Rowlet to number 802 Marshadow were introduced in Sun and Moon in 2016 and number 803 Poipole to number 807 Zeraora were released in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon in 2017. Two mythical Pokémon, Meltan and Melmetal, debuted in Pokémon Go in 2018; Meltan appears in the wild in Pokémon Go when a Pokémon is transferred to Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee!, while Melmetal is only obtainable by evolving Meltan in Pokémon Go when the player collects candies. In addition to the new species of Pokémon, two new forms of Zygarde appeared in Sun and Moon—having previously appeared in the Pokémon anime: the dog-like \"Zygarde 10% Forme\" and mech-like \"Zygarde Complete (100%) Forme\". Alternate forms that result in type changes and regional forms are included for convenience.\n\n",

The first games, Pocket Monsters Red and Green, were released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red Version and Blue Version. The main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), referred as the \"core series\" by their developers, has continued on each generation of Nintendo's handhelds. The most recently released core series games, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, were released on November 18, 2022, for the Nintendo Switch.\nIn addition to Game Freak's development, Creatures provides support through their Pokémon CG Studio, which creates 3D models for the Pokémon in the games, and also develops some spin-off titles. In 1998, Nintendo, Creatures, and Game Freak jointly established The Pokémon Company, which manages licensing, production, publishing, marketing and deals for the franchise both within Asia and worldwide through The Pokémon Company International.\nThe core games are released in generations, each with different Pokémon, storylines, and characters. Remakes of the games are usually released around a decade after the original versions for the latest console at the time. While the main series consists of RPGs developed by Game Freak, many spin-off games based on the series have been developed by various companies, encompassing other genres such as action role-playing, puzzle, fighting, and digital pet games.\nPokémon is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, with successful anime series, movies, and merchandise, with spin-off game Pokémon Go having crossed 1 billion mobile game downloads worldwide. By November 24, 2017, more than 300 million Pokémon games had been sold worldwide on handheld and home consoles, across 76 titles, including spin-offs. As of March 2025, the series has sold over 489 million units worldwide. This makes Pokémon the fourth best-selling video game franchise, behind Nintendo's own Mario franchise, Call of Duty, and Tetris.\n\n",

They are the first installments of the Pokémon video game series, and were first released in Japan as Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green, followed by the special edition Pocket Monsters Blue later that year. The games were released internationally in 1998 and 1999 as Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue, while an enhanced version named Pokémon Yellow Version: Special Pikachu Edition, was released in Japan in 1998 and in other regions in 1999 and 2000.\nThe player controls the protagonist from an overhead perspective and navigates the fictional region of Kanto in a quest to master Pokémon battling. The goal is to become the champion of the Indigo League by defeating the eight Gym Leaders and the top Pokémon trainers in the land, the Elite Four. Another objective is to complete the Pokédex, an in-game encyclopedia, by obtaining all 151 Pokémon. Red and Blue use the Game Link Cable, which connects two Game Boy systems and allows Pokémon to be traded or battled between games. Both versions feature the same plot, and while they can be played separately, players must trade between both games to obtain all of the original 151 Pokémon.\nRed and Blue were well-received, with critics praising the multiplayer options, especially the concept of trading. They received an aggregated score of 89% on GameRankings and are considered among the greatest games ever made, perennially ranked on top game lists including at least four years on IGN's \"Top 100 Games of All Time\".

When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.  AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player's mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world. Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.

      "summary": "Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game originally developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices. It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player's real-world location. The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports online purchases for additional in-game items as well as virtual and real-world events. The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, with several hundred more species being added as of 2025.\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems. It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year. It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic. However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances. Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use. The game had over 147 million monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than $6 billion in revenue by 2020.",

All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle. Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.

The plot focuses on Ash Ketchum (Lee Majdoub), a Pokémon Trainer who commands creatures called Pokémon to battle other Trainers' Pokémon to advance within a league setting. Formerly a global sport, it was long since outlawed due to outcries of animal abuse, and instead continued in underground arenas, where the fighting became much more brutal. Despite warnings by his friend Brock (Kial Natale), Ash takes part in the battles with his Pokémon, Pikachu. When approached by Giovanni (David Quast), the head of Rocket Industries, with a bribe to throw his next fight, Ash turns the offer down.

      "summary": "Pokémon Apokélypse is a 2010 Canadian fan-made adventure short film directed by Kial Natale and produced by Dylan Innes and Lee Majdoub. Based on the Pokémon franchise, the storyline takes place several years after the events of the original anime series. Intended as a fan-response to \"the common trend of 'dark and gritty' reboots of popular franchises\", the film was meant to give a mature spin on Pokémon and be in the same vein as work seen on parody website CollegeHumor. The creators initially intended to reveal the film at the Vancouver Anime Evolution convention, it was not shown due to technical difficulties. Instead on September 14, 2010, it revealed online via a teaser segment distributed through emails sent to various media outlets, which presented itself as a recording of a \"secret movie trailer screening\" for a film in development. The full film followed shortly thereafter, posted online on September 20.\nThe result of almost two years of work, the film follows Ash Ketchum and his friends years after the events of the original anime series, and their struggle against criminal organization Rocket Industries. Deciding on using the subject of Pokémon after considering several possibilities such as Grand Theft Auto and Dragon Ball Z, the producers were surprised by fan reaction to the material. Despite praises for the content, they have stated they have no intention to produce a full-fledged film.\nThe initial \"leaked\" preview was met with skepticism and criticism, with CraveOnline in particular recalling the trend of past video game-inspired films being of poor quality.

It was accompanied by the short Gotta Dance.\nThe film was released in theaters in Japan on July 19, 2003, by Toho. The English-language adaptation was distributed by Miramax Films and released direct-to-video on June 1, 2004. The events of the film take place during the sixth season of Pokémon: Advanced, being the first film to feature characters from Advanced Generation.\nThe featured song in this movie is Asuca Hayashi's A Small Thing (小さきもの, Chiisaki Mono) in the Japanese version while the English version, Make a Wish, was sung by Cindy Mizelle. The tune of this song is also used as the lullaby May and Max's mother used to sing to them when they were children. This is the first movie in which the original Japanese song is also clearly used in the English version, and the first time in which the names of the guest characters were the same in both the English and Japanese versions.\n\n",

Since Mimikyu's debut, it has appeared in multiple games including Pokémon Go and the Pokémon Trading Card Game, as well as the anime adaptation of the series where it is voiced by Billy Bob Thompson.\nClassified as a Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokemon, Mimikyu appears as a short creature with a crude Pikachu disguise over its body, and a stick serving as the disguise's tail. Its actual body under the disguise is a black blob with two round eyes, and it moves by dragging its body along the ground. Mimikyu is a lonely creature who wears the disguise in order to seek affection from humans within the Pokémon world, though in the anime one developed animosity towards Pikachu, often attacking it on sight. Mimikyu's lore and personality have received positive receptions from both critics and fans of the series.",

They overall resemble a cross-hybrid between a salamander and a hippopotamus and appear thick in body build. Pokédex entries suggest that they are an inactive Pokémon that have delayed reactions to pain and state the belief that rainfall can be summoned by the species' yawning. In the Pokémon world, Slowpoke tails are delicacies, and they are thought to often break off naturally and regrow afterward. In-game, Slowpoke are harvested for their tails by an antagonistic faction called Team Rocket for profits in the Pokémon Gold and Silver titles and their remakes, but later games have normalized Slowpoke tails as delicacy items.\nSlowpoke is a popular Pokémon for promotions under The Pokémon Company, as it comes in various forms of Japanese merchandise and is the featured Pokémon for a reggae-style song with a 2014 Japanese version and a 2015 English version, the latter of which is called \"The Slowpoke Song\". Most notably, it is officially the \"ambassador Pokémon\" for the Kagawa Prefecture of Japan since 2018 in reference to a pun between the \"Yadon\" name and the udon noodles as well as its rumored ability to bring rainfall since the region suffers from droughts. Within the Kagawa Prefecture, it has been the subject of several April Fool's Day jokes, is celebrated on August 10 under Slowpoke Day, and is prominently featured in many goods and services within the area. Slowpoke has received generally positive receptions for its \"charming\" nature and comedic elements and is a popular subject within internet culture.",

In 1996, Nintendo released the slimmer Game Boy Pocket, and the launch of the Pokémon series that same year further boosted sales. However, developers were losing interest in creating new games for the aging platform.\nAdditional market pressure for Nintendo came in October 1997 when news broke about Bandai's new handheld, the WonderSwan. The project was led by Gunpei Yokoi, the engineer who led the development of the Game & Watch series and the original Game Boy. Yokoi had left Nintendo in 1996 following the commercial failure of his final project at the company, the Virtual Boy. His departure caused a stir, with investors dumping Nintendo stock, forcing a temporary halt on trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Yokoi was killed in a roadside accident in 1997 before the WonderSwan's release.\n"

Compared to the original Game Boy, the Game Boy Color features a color TFT screen rather than monochrome, a CPU that can operate twice as fast, and four times as much memory. It retains backward compatibility with games developed for its predecessor. The Game Boy Color is part of the fifth generation of video game consoles and primarily competed with the WonderSwan, Neo Geo Pocket, and Genesis Nomad.\nThe handheld is slightly thicker, taller and has a smaller screen than its immediate predecessor, the Game Boy Pocket, but is significantly smaller than the original Game Boy. As with its predecessors, the Game Boy Color has a custom 8-bit processor made by Sharp. The American English spelling of the system's name, Game Boy Color, remains consistent throughout the world.\nThe Game Boy Color received positive reviews upon release, and was praised for its backwards compatibility with games from its predecessor. It had a relatively brief lifespan, being succeeded by the Game Boy Advance after less than three years on the market. The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color combined have sold 118.69 million units worldwide, making them the fourth best-selling system of all time. Its best-selling games are Pokémon Gold and Silver (1999), which shipped 23 million units worldwide.\n\n",

The song's prominent instruments are electric piano and acoustic guitar, with record scratching sounds layering the production in the chorus in a style akin to Hanson's \"MMMBop\". The final chorus repeats with ad-libbed background vocals until the song fades out.\nLyrically, the song is about getting \"the rules straight on a budding relationship: Slow down and don't say you love me until you give me some time and get to know me.\" According to musicologist Jon Mikkel Broc"

The song first appeared on Radio Disney before its official US radio and single release in October 1999. It was released on the soundtrack to the film Pokémon: The First Movie in November 1999 and appears in the film's closing credits. The song was featured on M2M's debut album, Shades of Purple (2000) as its opening track, and was later included on their compilation album The Day You Went Away: The Best of M2M (2003).\nThe song received positive reviews. Chuck Taylor from Billboard said it was \"absolutely enchanting\" and would appeal to both young and mature listeners. It reached number 2 in Norway, number 4 in both Australia and New Zealand, number 16 in the UK and number 21 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was certified gold in the US and Australia and remained M2M's biggest hit. M2M performed the song on episodes of the television series One World, Top of the Pops and Disney Channel in Concert. Two similar music videos were released for the song, with one showing clips from Pokémon: The First Movie.",

Compared to the other consoles on the market at the time, including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the Switch had less-powerful computational hardware to keep the unit's price low, but sufficient to power the type of games Nintendo typically publishes; part of the company's long-term Blue Ocean Strategy to differentiate itself from the other console manufacturers.

It is generally considered a marketing term to represent the version of a film the director prefers, and is usually used in contrast to a theatrical release of that film where the director did not have final cut privilege and did not agree with what was released. The word \"cut\" is used in this context as a synecdoche to refer to the entire film editing process and the resulting product. Traditionally, films were edited by literally cutting strips of film and splicing them together. \nMost of the time, film directors do not have the \"final cut\" (final say on the version released to the public). Those with money invested in the film, such as the production companies, distributors, or studios, may make changes intended to make the film more profitable at the box office. In extreme cases that can sometimes mean a different ending, less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting rating, but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day.\nWith the rise of home video, the phrase became more generically used as a marketing term to communicate to consumers that this is the director's preferred edit of a film, and it implies the director was not happy with the version that was originally released. Sometimes there are big disagreements between the director's vision and the producer's vision, and the director's preferred edit is sought after by fans (for example Terry Gilliam's Brazil).\nNot all films have separate \"director's cuts\" (often the director is happy with the theatrical release, even if they didn't have final cut privilege), and sometimes separate versions of films are released as \"director's cuts\" even if the director doesn't prefer them. Once such example is Ridley Scott's Alien, which had a \"director's cut\" released in 2003, even though the director said it was purely for \"marketing purposes\" and didn't represent his preferred vision for the film.\nSometimes alternate edits are released, which are not necessarily director's preferred cuts, but which showcase different visions for the project for fans to enjoy. Examples include James Cameron's Avatar, which was released as both a \"Special Edition\" and \"Extended\" cuts, and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, which were released on home video as \"Extended Editions\".

In the 1970s and '80s, Nintendo made arcade games, the Color TV-Game series of home game consoles, and the Game & Watch series of handheld electronic games. Shigeru Miyamoto designed the arcade game Donkey Kong (1981): Nintendo's first international hit video game, and the origin of the company's mascot, Mario.

Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka's innovative NES titles, Super Mario Bros. (1985) and The Legend of Zelda (1986), were highly influential to video games.\nThe Game Boy handheld console (1989) and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System home console (1990) were successful, while Nintendo had an intense business rivalry with console maker Sega. The Virtual Boy (1995), a portable console with stereoscopic 3D graphics, was a critical and financial failure.
