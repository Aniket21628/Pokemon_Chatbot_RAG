# 🧠 Pokemon Chatbot – NLP-Powered Conversational Assistant

An interactive chatbot that intelligently identifies Pokémon names from user input and responds contextually using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a fine-tuned DistilBERT model.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧬 **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using `spaCy` to extract Pokémon names from user queries.
- 🤖 **Transformer-based classification** with fine-tuned `DistilBERT` for high-accuracy predictions.
- 💬 Simulated conversational interface using a command-line chat experience.
- 📊 Achieved over **95% accuracy** in classifying Pokémon-related user intents.
- 📁 Built and trained using a clean data pipeline with tokenization, attention masking, and padding.
